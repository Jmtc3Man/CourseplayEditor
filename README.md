Courseplay Editor
================

Courseplay Editor is a tool to editing courses from Farming Simulator 2011 and 2013 savegames.
The idea is based from the old Courseplay Path Editor that was made for Farming Simulator 2011, but since it lacks the support of the new features in Courseplay 3.4 for Farming Simulator 2013 and some more user friendly updates for handling the tools, I have decided to make a total new one from scratch, that should be possible to port over to other platforms as well and not only Windows.

Features:
================
Auto detect Farming Simulator 2011/2013 game and savegame folder.
Automatic get PDA map image from standard game and for mod maps as well.
Edit currently existing saved courses.
Create new courses.
Able to create lanes like the Course Generator do. (Only for FS2013)
Quick select tools from a right click menu on the map area.
Mouse scroll zooms the map in and out. (Feature was missing on the old Path editor).
+ more.

Installing:
================
More info when it's ready for alpha and beta testing.
